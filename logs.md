## Day 0

- gem5 has stopped working, however worked sometime back 
- need to write the code for MM
- need to get atleast one code running after gem5 compiles over all the ISAs
- complete watching this video

## Day 1

- complete this and shift over the Networks and OS
- Need to get some useful work done 
- So this is the plan:
    - Read the performance metrics tonight
    - get a code working tomorrow morning
    - write code for matrix multiplication and create a submission file tomorrow
    - Loop from 2nd step

## Day 2

- ALL is failing every time, need to stop running that and start working on the existing ISAs
- results that are needed to be published are as follows
    - Make a simple stats for hello.py (Performance Metrics)
    - Changes to make for the MM code
        - CPU
        - CPU Frequency 
        - Memory Configuration

    - make graphs like this:
        - y axis always performance 
        - x axis 2 differnt CPU stuck together
        - frequency plots
        - plan1: keep performance vs frequency plot and change the (CPU, Memory) pair to notice chnages
        - plan2: perf vs CPU Model at fixed (frequency, Mem Arch), different CPU

## Day 3

- Need to work on the following today:
    - correct the matrix multiplication code
    - how to change CPU Model 
    - how to change CPU Frequency
    - how to change mem configs

    - work on the code for plotting various graphs

- completed some refractoring of config script code
- have to find all the type of memory and their respective processor required to run
